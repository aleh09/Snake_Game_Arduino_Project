# Snake Game Arduino Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to develop a game using an arduino nano, joystick, IC2 display, seven segment display, and sound buzzer. For the project I created a snake game using the Arduino nano. The movement of the snake is controlled by the joystick and the game is displayed on an IC2 screen. Also, the score is kept track on a seven-segment display and whenever the snake eats a piece of food a sound is played on the buzzer.
