# Snake Game Arduino Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to develop a game using an arduino nano, joystick, IC2 display, seven segment display, and sound buzzer to demonstrate what we have learned in our embedded systems course. For the project I created a snake game using the Arduino nano. The movement of the snake is controlled by the joystick and the game is displayed on an IC2 screen. Also, the score is kept track on a seven-segment display and whenever the snake eats a piece of food a sound is played on the buzzer.

## How The Game Works
Just like the classic snake game, food is spawned randomly on the display screen, and when the snake runs into the food with its head the score increments by one, the snake's body grows longer, and the speed of the snake is increased. If you run into the walls of the display screen or the body of the snake the game is over and the Zelda Lullaby song plays from the sound buzzer. To win the game you must collect 9 pieces of food without running into the walls or yourself. When you win Ode to Joy plays from the sound buzzer, and the game restarts.
